# AI_Project
This is the repo that will be for our AI Project since I'm traveling and will be stupid and somehow lose it. Create branches if its experimental, but if you're 100% set on something just update the current branch you work on. Make sure to add your own branch. We'll leave the master one for big breakthrough improvements.
